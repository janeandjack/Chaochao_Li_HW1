My name is Chaochao Li, and people always call me Scott. I was born in Hubei Province, China and raised in Guangdong province, China. My favorite movie is Predestination which inspires me to make my life better. My favorite music is Something just like this. Most males want to be a superhero and I am no exception. I like to read everything in Chinese versions, such as newspapers, specification, and novel. I can not stand the person speak tedious sentences because once you want to explain something, you should speak simple and clear.
